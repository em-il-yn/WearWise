# WearWise

## Making fashion more mindful

WearWise is an app that aims to reduce overconsumption of clothing, and to better inform users of their purchasing 
patterns. Users on ClosetCost will be able to log each of their clothing items along with it's brand, cost, 
material, and colour. Everyday the user will be prompted to log what they have worn that day. Overtime they will be
able to access their personal clothing data allowing them to make more informed clothing purchases in the future.
Data will include:
- cost per wear for each item
- average cost per wear by brand
- average cost per wear by material
- average cost per wear by colour

This data will allow users to avoid microtrends by allowing them to analyze their own wear history. It will allow 
them to better asses when to splurge on a clothing item and when to save. Ultimately this should lead to a lower 
consumption of clothing by allowing users to break out of patterns that are harmful to their wallets and the planet.
